## Base URL

The Amisend API is built on REST principles. We enforce HTTPS in every request to improve data security, integrity, and privacy. The API does not support HTTP.

All requests contain the following base URL:

```cli
https://api.amisend.com
```

## Authentication

To authenticate you need to add an Authorization header with the contents of the header being Bearer ami_xxxxxxxxx where ami_xxxxxxxxx is your [API Key](https://amisend.com/api-keys).

```cli
Authorization: Bearer ami_xxxxxxxxx
```
